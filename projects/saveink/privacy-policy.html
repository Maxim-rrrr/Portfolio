        PRIVACY POLICY
      </div>

      <p class="paragraph">
        <div class="paragraph__text">
          Privacy Policy is a special document, created by the official owner of SaveInk. It regulates the relationships
          between him and the users regarding personal data processing. We shared this text to inform everybody about
          the relevant terms of data collecting, keeping and processing. All the following statements and rules are
          accepted automatically after installing SaveInk.
        </div>
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        <div class="paragraph__title">
          1. Information about data gathering
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__text">
          The owner of this application doesn’t collect personal or non-personal data by asking the user to fill in any
          registration forms (or any other type of direct information gathering). Nevertheless, he is allowed to collect
          and use the data supplied by the user (wittingly or accidentally) or obtained from the open sources. The
          collected data may include: the user’s real name, age, sex, email, phone number, network service.
          In addition, we need to gather some non-personal data, which lets customize our service according to the
          device requirements. We also collect and use Log data (crash information) if the user faces a mistake while
          using the application.
        </div>
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        <div class="paragraph__title">
          2. Information about data usage
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__text">
          The owner of SaveInk needs to collect and process some of the user’s personal and non-personal information.
          Firstly, the received data helps us improve the service and make it correspond to all the main needs of a
          common user. Secondly, we also have to ensure the highest level of protection for our product, so it’s
          important to gather the information about the user’s activity.
          Data collecting also helps the owner of SaveInk make the application’s interface and functions match the
          particular user’s needs better. Mainly, we need the user’s personal and non-personal information to improve
          the service and let the user get the best usage experience.
        </div>

      <p class="paragraph">
        <div class="paragraph__title">
          3. Cookies
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__text">
          By running SaveInk, the user accepts Cookies’ policy automatically. The cookie file (or similar tracking
          technologies), installed on the device, gathers the information about the user’s individual preferences and
          online activity.
          Such data is necessary for us, because it lets the owner of the application learn the user’s needs and improve
          the service according to them. Cookies’ policy may be declined from the device Settings menu by the user at
          any moment. Nevertheless, this will affect the service.

        <div class="paragraph__title">
          4. Third-party advertising
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__text">
          The owner of SaveInk has a right to cooperate with third-party advertising companies to provide better
          service. They procure the correct ad stream and place advertising banners on the screen, while the application
          is launched. They also require some information about the user’s geolocation, preferences and so on to improve
          the effectiveness of ads and customize them.

          5. Safety and data protection
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__text">
          The owner of SaveInk works hard on assuring the highest level of protection. All the information about the
          user (supplied by him or obtained from open sources) is kept securely. We apply all the known methods, which
          correspond to generally accepted standards. Nevertheless, only the user is fully responsible for all kinds of
          virtual actions he performs using SaveInk. The owner of the app isn’t responsible for the uploaded documents
          and their legitimacy. We do not share these files anyhow.

          6. Permissions we require
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__text">
          The correct usage of SaveInk and all its functions requires Gallery and Camera access. Part of the app’s
          functionality depends on these permissions. The user should be aware that in case he denies access, then it is
          impossible to use the program properly.

          To reach the desirable efficiency of distribution and advertising, the owner of SaveInk reserves the right to
          use special platforms designed for such needs. Basically, they include their own analytical and statistical
          services, which can be used by the application owner in order to distribute and market the product. The main
          platform we use is App Store - an official platform, designed by Apple Inc.
